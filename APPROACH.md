# :thinking: Project Evaluation & Approach

Before beginning implementation, I spent time evaluating the requirements, identifying potential complexities, and exploring existing solutions to inform my approach.

# :dart: Core Objectives

My personal goal with any project is to focus on great UI/UX, component reusability, and scalable architecture ‚Äî building systems that can extend beyond the immediate problem. For this challenge, I aimed to design a foundation that could support not only this form builder but also other schema-driven interfaces in the future.

# :mag: Evaluation & Research

Requirements comprehension: Carefully reviewed the challenge multiple times to identify complex areas ‚Äî notably schema import/export, conditional visibility, validation rules, and state persistence.

UX exploration: Looked closely at Google Forms and OpnForm to understand simple, clear form-building interactions and how those tools structure field editing, option management, and preview states.

## Library decisions:

Component library: I have prior experience with shadcn/ui, which recently released updated form primitives that simplify code and improve consistency. This made it an excellent choice for rapid UI development.

Form and validation stack: After reviewing the latest documentation, I selected TanStack Form and Zod, both officially recommended by shadcn for modern React form handling. I‚Äôve used each to a limited degree before, but this combination offered the cleanest integration and strongest TypeScript support.

Reference implementation: I referenced a recent [Web Dev Simplified video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjrXeqgxbas) and its accompanying open-source example, which demonstrated using shadcn/ui, TanStack Form, and Zod together. This accelerated initial setup and reinforced best practices for type-safe, schema-driven forms.

Architecture considerations: Planned two distinct modes ‚Äî Builder (for form design and schema definition) and Preview (for validation and mock submission). This separation encourages clean boundaries between schema configuration and runtime execution.

# :jigsaw: Guiding Principles

- System thinking: Treat builder, schema, and preview as modular layers.
- Reusability: Build generic, composable components that can scale into a broader form system.
- Scalability: Use patterns that can evolve to support nested schemas or API-bound field types.
- User experience: Prioritize immediate visual feedback, clear validation messaging, and an intuitive, low-friction editing flow.

## October 22 ‚Äî Day 1 ¬∑ Project Setup & Foundation

### ‚úÖ Core Setup

- [x] Bootstrapped Vite + React + TypeScript project
- [x] Added Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui configuration
- [x] Integrated TanStack Form and Router for form and navigation structure
- [x] Created consistent CSS variable and theme setup
- [x] Added Toaster and Card components for app scaffolding

### ‚úÖ Form Infrastructure

- [x] Implemented foundational form components (FormBase, FormControl, Select, CheckboxGroup)
- [x] Established prop typing and component conventions for reusability

### ‚úÖ Developer Tooling

- [x] Integrated TanStack DevTools and debugging utilities
- [x] Verified routing and form state inspection

## October 23 ‚Äî Day 2 ¬∑ Core Builder Features

### üß± Builder Functionality

- [x] Implemented Add Field flow
- [x] Added support for field types: text, textarea, number, select, radio, checkbox, and date
- [x] Supported editable attributes: label, name, placeholder, helpText, required, defaultValue
- [ ] Remove, reorder, and edit field functionality (planned)

### ‚öôÔ∏è Validation System

- [x] Integrated Zod validation
- [x] Added validation for required, min/max, and regex (pattern + custom)
- [x] Improved error messages with Zod refine() for readability

### üíæ State Persistence & Modes

- [x] Implemented localStorage save/load/reset for builder state
- [x] Added builder vs. preview modes with context and routing integration
- [x] Created live preview layout with form and JSON schema side-by-side

### üß† Utilities & Architecture

- [x] Added schema utilities for JSON export
- [x] Separated builder (design) and preview (runtime validation) layers for clarity

## üßæ Requirements Coverage

### ‚úÖ Completed

- [x] Field creation (add fields with basic properties)
- [x] All field types (text, textarea, number, select, radio, checkbox, date)
- [x] Validation system using Zod (required, min/max, regex)
- [x] LocalStorage persistence (save/load/reset)
- [x] Builder and preview mode architecture
- [x] JSON schema export foundation
- [x] Human-readable validation messages
- [x] Write short documentation notes explaining architectural tradeoffs and next-phase plans

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Remaining / Deferred

- [ ] Remove, reorder, and edit fields
- [ ] Conditional visibility (e.g., show ‚ÄúState‚Äù if country = US)
- [ ] Mock submission (latency + random success/failure)

## üß≠ Next Steps & Prioritization

Given time constraints and overall scope, next steps are being prioritized by demonstrating end-to-end flow and system completeness rather than 100% feature coverage:

### Planned next:

- [ ] Implement mock submission with success/failure handling to demonstrate validation + error states
- [ ] Add one simple conditional visibility rule (hardcoded example) to show system extensibility
