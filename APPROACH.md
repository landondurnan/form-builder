# Reviewing this project

If you're reviewing any aspect of this project I think it's important to recognize where my primary contribution was in the code and what came from other resources:

- `/components/ui` are reusable components that comes directly from ShadCN
- `/components/form` is a slightly modified version of components generated by Web Dev Simplified to teach ShadCN `Field` component and TanStack Forms. These are more opinionated ways of combining the generic UI components to work better with TanStack.
- `/components/builder` make up the bulk of the project and implementation of the project requirements. This code was either written directly by me or through the assistant of Github Copilot (Claude Haiku 4.5). The UI / UX was partially inspired by OpnForm.

# :thinking: Project Evaluation & Approach

Before beginning implementation, I spent time evaluating the requirements, identifying potential complexities, and exploring existing solutions to inform my approach.

# :dart: Core Objectives

My personal goal with any project is to focus on great UI/UX, component reusability, and scalable architecture ‚Äî building systems that can extend beyond the immediate problem. For this challenge, I aimed to design a foundation that could support not only this form builder but also other schema-driven interfaces in the future.

# :mag: Evaluation & Research

Requirements comprehension: Carefully reviewed the challenge multiple times to identify complex areas ‚Äî notably schema import/export, conditional visibility, validation rules, and state persistence.

UX exploration: Looked closely at Google Forms and OpnForm to understand simple, clear form-building interactions and how those tools structure field editing, option management, and preview states.

## Library decisions:

Component library: I have prior experience with shadcn/ui, which recently released updated form primitives that simplify code and improve consistency. This made it an excellent choice for rapid UI development.

Form and validation stack: After reviewing the latest documentation, I selected TanStack Form and Zod, both officially recommended by shadcn for modern React form handling. I‚Äôve used each to a limited degree before, but this combination offered the cleanest integration and strongest TypeScript support.

Reference implementation: I referenced a recent [Web Dev Simplified video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjrXeqgxbas) and its accompanying open-source example, which demonstrated using shadcn/ui, TanStack Form, and Zod together. This accelerated initial setup and reinforced best practices for type-safe, schema-driven forms.

Architecture considerations: Planned two distinct modes ‚Äî Builder (for form design and schema definition) and Preview (for validation and mock submission). This separation encourages clean boundaries between schema configuration and runtime execution.

# :jigsaw: Guiding Principles

- System thinking: Treat builder, schema, and preview as modular layers.
- Reusability: Build generic, composable components that can scale into a broader form system.
- Scalability: Use patterns that can evolve to support nested schemas or API-bound field types.
- User experience: Prioritize immediate visual feedback, clear validation messaging, and an intuitive, low-friction editing flow.

### ‚úÖ Form Infrastructure

- [x] Implemented foundational form components (FormBase, FormControl, Select, CheckboxGroup)
- [x] Established prop typing and component conventions for reusability

### ‚úÖ Developer Tooling

- [x] Integrated TanStack DevTools and debugging utilities
- [x] Verified routing and form state inspection

## October 23 ‚Äî Day 2 ¬∑ Core Builder Features

### üß± Builder Functionality

- [x] Implemented Add Field flow
- [x] Added support for field types: text, textarea, number, select, radio, checkbox, and date
- [x] Supported editable attributes: label, name, placeholder, helpText, required, defaultValue
- [ ] Remove, reorder, and edit field functionality (planned)

### ‚öôÔ∏è Validation System

- [x] Integrated Zod validation
- [x] Added validation for required, min/max, and regex (pattern + custom)
- [x] Improved error messages with Zod refine() for readability

### üíæ State Persistence & Modes

- [x] Implemented localStorage save/load/reset for builder state
- [x] Added builder vs. preview modes with context and routing integration
- [x] Created live preview layout with form and JSON schema side-by-side

### üß† Utilities & Architecture

- [x] Added schema utilities for JSON export
- [x] Separated builder (design) and preview (runtime validation) layers for clarity

## October 24 ‚Äî Day 3 ¬∑ Field Management & Schema Export/Import

### ‚úÖ Field Lifecycle Management

- [x] Implemented field editing in sidebar with AddFieldForm
- [x] Added field reordering (move up/down) with index tracking
- [x] Added field deletion with state cleanup
- [x] Extracted EditFieldActions component for code organization
- [x] Selection state properly tracks field movements and deletions

### ‚úÖ Schema Export/Import

- [x] Rewrote `exportFormAsJSONSchema()` to manually build JSON Schema (removed Zod dependency from export)
- [x] Fixed validation constraint mapping: `minLength`/`maxLength` for strings, `minimum`/`maximum` for numbers/dates
- [x] Import function correctly extracts and reconstructs validation rules
- [x] Forms can now export and reimport without data loss

### ‚úÖ Form Organization

- [x] Reorganized AddFieldForm with tabbed interface (Basic | Options | Validation tabs)
- [x] Improved sidebar UX by reducing cognitive load

### ‚úÖ Mock Submission System

- [x] Implemented form submission with validation feedback
- [x] Added submission status tracking (idle, loading, success, error)
- [x] Implemented configurable latency simulation for realistic UX testing
- [x] Implemented random failure simulation with configurable failure rate
- [x] Display submitted data preview on successful submission
- [x] Toast notifications for success/error feedback

## üßæ Requirements Coverage

### ‚úÖ Completed

- [x] Field creation (add fields with basic properties)
- [x] All field types (text, textarea, number, select, radio, checkbox, date)
- [x] Validation system using Zod (required, min/max, regex)
- [x] Remove, reorder, and edit fields
- [x] LocalStorage persistence (save/load/reset)
- [x] Builder and preview mode architecture
- [x] JSON schema export/import
- [x] Mock submission with configurable latency and failure simulation
- [x] Human-readable validation messages
- [x] Real-time form validation feedback

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Remaining / Deferred

- [ ] Conditional visibility (e.g., show "State" if country = US)

Brainstorming conditional visibility we would need to add support in our schema definition and field metadata with a new option like `visibleIf`, our Tanstack form and Zod schema and would need to consider this constraint for rendering and validation.
